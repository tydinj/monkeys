					Body of squirrel monkeys is covered with fur that is mostly olive or grey in color. 
					Their face, ears and throat are white. Mouths are black. Backs and extremities are 
					covered with yellow-orange fur. Squirrel monkeys are small in size. Males are bigger 
					than females. On average, they can reach 9.8 to 14 inches in height and 1.7 to 2.4 
					pounds in weight. Long tail of squirrel monkeys is not prehensile, but it provides 
					balance when they move through the treetops. Squirrel monkeys are arboreal animals. 
					They spend 99% of their lives in the trees. Squirrel monkeys have excellent eyesight 
					and they are able to distinguish colors. This feature facilitates quick identification
					of fruit among dense vegetation. Squirrel monkeys are one of the most clever monkeys. 
					They have very large brains in comparison to their body size. Squirrel monkeys live 
					in large groups called "troops". A troop may consist of up to 500 members, but it is 
					usually smaller, composed of 40 to 50 members. Communication inside the troop is 
					accomplished through 25 to 30 different calls. Squirrel monkeys produced different 
					sounds when they are searching for food, during the mating season and when they are 
					threatened. Squirrel monkeys are omnivores. They eat different types of flowers, 
					leaves, buds, nuts, insects, lizards and eggs. Due to their small size, 
					squirrel monkeys are easy prey of birds of prey and snakes. Squirrel monkeys can 
					survive 15 years in the wild and 20 years in captivity.
